# 🔍 Overview

This project implements a real-time, FFT-driven water simulation system capable of rendering large ocean surfaces with realistic wave motion, choppiness, and wind interaction — all computed entirely on the GPU.

Instead of solving full 3D Navier–Stokes equations, the simulation represents the ocean surface as a heightfield derived from a wave energy spectrum in the frequency domain. The surface is updated each frame using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), allowing thousands of interacting waves to evolve seamlessly and in real time.

# 🧠 Background and Influences

This project draws inspiration from several key works in computer graphics fluid simulation:

### Jerry Tessendorf — “Simulating Ocean Water”
The foundation of this project. Tessendorf introduced FFT-based spectral synthesis for ocean surfaces, where wave amplitudes and phases are generated from statistical ocean models. This allows complex, realistic surfaces to be computed efficiently.

### Jos Stam — “Stable Fluids for Games”
Stam’s method inspired the system’s stability and time integration strategies, ensuring smooth evolution without requiring tiny time steps — critical for real-time rendering.

### Horvath’s Improvements
Introduced directional spreading functions, choppy wave displacement, and spectral filtering. These make waves sharper, more wind-dependent, and visually richer by redistributing energy realistically across frequencies.

### Arc Blanc’s Refinements
Improved energy conservation and amplitude normalization in Tessendorf’s model. This ensures waves maintain consistent visual strength at different grid resolutions, avoiding the “flat” or “overblown” look common in uncorrected implementations.

_**Together, these techniques form a modern GPU ocean simulation pipeline — stable, scalable, and visually believable.**_

# 🧩 Technical Details

### Language: C++

### Rendering: Vulkan / GLSL

### Simulation Core: GPU-accelerated FFT (based on vkFFT)

### Data Representation: 2D complex frequency grids for displacement and choppiness

### Performance: Real-time simulation of 256×256 wave grids at 60+ FPS on mid-range GPUs

# 🌬️ How It Works

### Spectrum Generation:
The system initializes a Phillips or unified spectrum representing the ocean’s frequency energy based on wind direction, speed, and gravity constants.

### FFT Evolution:
Using a GPU-based FFT, the spectral data is advanced over time, evolving each wave’s amplitude and phase.

### Inverse FFT:
The frequency-domain data is transformed back into spatial heightfields and normal maps.

### Choppy Displacement:
Horvath’s horizontal displacement technique is applied to sharpen wave crests.

### Rendering:
The final heightfield is rendered using physically based shading, normal reconstruction, and seamless tiling.
